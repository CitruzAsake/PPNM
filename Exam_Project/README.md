My student number ends with 96 I have the exam question 8: One-sided Jacobi algorithm for Singular Value Decomposition. This exam problem has the following problemformulation:
"Implement the one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm."

The Exam project has a folder called "Exam Project".

The exercises have a folder for themselves called "Exercise".

The solved exercises are:

Exercise_math
